     <div class="column"/><p>When people ask me what I want to do when I grow up I always tell them the same thing, I want to work as a pediatrician or a computer repair technician.  To achieve that, I will do some of my own research on those careers and get involved with classes that apply knowledge about them. The reason why I would like to do pediatrics is because I have always like being around kids and the idea of being to help them out in a medical way since it makes me feel like a better person. I would also like to be a computer repair technician because technology is in our everyday lives now and being able to understand it can help me in the future.
The characteristics that I that I show for these jobs are that I am cooperative by always helping the most that I can with the abilities I possess, which will help me in both careers when I am working with others. I am also an adaptable person; it takes me a few time to adapt to the environment around me. I also consider myself a friendly person and the reason is that I always find something to talk about to make the other person comfortable. One major accomplishment I have done so far in high school is complete my community service hours. Most of the time I procrastinate and then rush things until the last minute but this time I completed something important on time. What I have learned about myself in computer science is that when I am struggling on a topic, I try fixing the problem by myself first so I can test my knowledge and then ask someone else when I am unsure. 
These characteristics and experiences will help me with being a pediatrician or a computer repair technician because I need to be caring towards the people I work with and help. I also need to be patient so I will not miss anything and when I get stuck, ask others for help because I am not always going to do things by myself.
